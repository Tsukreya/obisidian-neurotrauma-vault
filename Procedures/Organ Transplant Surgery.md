# Organ Transplant Surgery

 

---

Make sure to use [[azathioprine]] before placing the organ in, and make sure their immunity is 10% or lower. If organ damage is 100% after placing it in, that means it got rejected. This does not apply if organ rejection is turned off in the config.

## Steps:

**1.** Anesthetic of your choice ([[anesthesia]])
**2.** [[Scalpel]]
**3.** [[Hemostat]]
**4.** [[Retractors]]
**5.** The respective [[organ procurement scalpels]]
**6.** The respective organ transplant item (This must be done twice for the kidneys)
**7.** [[Sutures]]
