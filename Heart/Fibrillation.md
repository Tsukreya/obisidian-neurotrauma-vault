# Fibrillation

 

---

Fibrillation is a 3-step process. At first, it will begin as [[increased heartrate]], which will increase slowly. Upon reaching 100% [[increased heartrate]], it will become [[irregular heartbeat]], which will also increase, and will become [[cardiac arrest]] upon hitting 100%. Additionally, there is a chance for [[irregular heartbeat]] to immediately skip to [[cardiac arrest]], which scales depending on how much irregular heartrate you have. Fibrillation gain is halved when under the effects of [[nitroglycerin]].
