# Traumatic Amputation

 

---

Traumatic amputation is the non-[[surgical amputation]] of an extremity. A traumatic amputation will act the exact same as a [[arterial bleeding]] upon first getting amputated. A limb must be fractured in order to become traumatically amputated.

- [[Material loss]] (99% or more)


## Causes:

### In all traumatic amputations:
- [[Arterial bleeding]]
- [[Intense pain]]

### In leg amputations: 
- 1 leg amputation will halve speed
- 2 leg amputations will ragdoll you and remove your ability to speak.

### In arm amputations:
- 1 arm amputation will prevent you from using that arm (you cant hold 2-handed items anymore)
- 2 arm amputations will prevent you from interacting with anything, such as doors, ladders, buttons, etc.
