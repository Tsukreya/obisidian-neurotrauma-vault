# Kidney Damage

 

---

Kidney damage is usually survivable, as even if it has progressed to kidney failure, it will still kill extremely slowly. Kidney damage will not heal below 50% damage if it passes the 50% threshold, as one of the kidneys has died. The kidneys will heal at a rate of 0.01% per second if one kidney is alive, and will heal at a rate of 0.02% per second if both kidneys are alive, assuming that the config is unchanged and nothing is damaging them.

## Caused by:

- Broad spectrum antibiotics
- [[Liquid oxygenite]](70%)
- [[Mannitol]]
- [[Radiation sickness]] (33% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration, 29% if one kidney is dead)
- [[Hypertension]] (184% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration, 152% if one kidney is dead)
- [[Sepsis]] (6% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration, 3% if one kidney is dead)
- [[Hypoxemia]] (8% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration, 4% if one kidney is dead)

## Causes:

- [[Leg swelling]] (at 60% or more)
- [[Acidosis]] (at 80% or more)
- [[Hypertension]]
- [[Bone damage]] (at 72% or more, point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- [[Vomiting]] (at 60% or more)
- [[Neurotrauma]] (will neutralize natural regeneration completely at 100%)
- [[Nausea]] (at 60% or more)
