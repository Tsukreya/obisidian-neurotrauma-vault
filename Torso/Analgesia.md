# Analgesia

 

---

The first step in **all** surgical procedures. Analgesia is an affliction that prevents [[traumatic shock]] during surgery and relieves pain. [[Traumatic shock]] will still occur if surgery is performed without a table. Analgesia will also give you damage resistance, scaling up to a maximum of 50% resistance at 200%.
