# Stasis Bag

 

---

A special bag that keeps the body in stasis for transportation to proper treatment if injuries are severe. A stasis bag is worn in the diving suit slot, and wearing it will drain the condition of it by 0.25% per second, meaning a stasis bag will last for 400 seconds or roughly 6 and a half minutes. Wearing a stasis bag will protect the wearer from pressure down to 10,000 meters, will allow the wearer to be dragged at full speed, and will stop the negative effects of the following afflictions:
- [[Cardiac arrest]]
- [[Respiratory arrest]]
- [[Heart attack]]
- [[Neurotrauma]]
- [[Kidney damage]]
- [[Liver damage]]
- [[Heart damage]]
- [[Lung damage]]
- [[Bone damage]]
- [[Sepsis]]
- [[Hypoxemia]]
- [[Hypotension]]
- [[Hypertension]]
- [[Acidosis]]
- [[Alkalosis]]
- [[Internal bleeding]]
- [[Stroke]]
- [[Seizure]]
- [[Coma]]
- [[Infected wounds]]
- Bleeding

It should be noted that you cannot perform surgery on people while they are inside of a Stasis Bag. They will need to be removed from the bag prior to surgery. Patients removed from the Stasis Bag will have [[respiratory arrest]] and will need those afflictions treated.
