# Hematology Analyzer

 

---

### Medical skill check: 30

### Application success:
+1% [[blood loss]]

### Application failure:
+3% [[blood loss]]

Either failing or passing the skill check will also give you a readout of all the blood-related ailments your patient has, such as [[hemotransfusion shock]]. Putting a donor card in the analyzer and then using it will print their blood type onto the donor card, and put it in their id card slot, allowing you to check their blood type later without the analyzer.
