# Combat Stimulant

 

---

Combat Stimulant is a stimulant that also doubles as a first aid item.
From 1% to 10% strength, the chemical treats [[withdrawal]] by 1% a second until the affliction's strength decreases to 0% or progresses beyond 10% when another injection is received. The player is also given 45% Stun resistance at 10%. This bonus decreases with the affliction strength.

From 11% to 100% strength, the chemical treats the previous damage types at 2% a second and provides the player with 45% to 50% Stun resistance.
