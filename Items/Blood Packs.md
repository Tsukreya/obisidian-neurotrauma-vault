# Blood Packs

 

---

Blood packs are acquired from using an empty blood-pack on a human with less than 31% [[blood loss]]. Blood packs must be administered to the correct bloodtype, which is stated in the description of the item.

### Compatible blood type application
-30% [[blood loss]]
+30% blood pressure

### Incompatible blood type application
-20% [[blood loss]]
+30% blood pressure
+100% [[hemotransfusion shock]]

If the human that the blood pack came from was suffering from either [[sepsis]], then those afflictions will also be given to whoever the blood is given to (affliction gained will be the donor's affliction level at time of extraction divided by 5). Additionally, if the recipient of the blood has either [[acidosis]] and [[alkalosis]], the transfusion of neutral blood will move the blood pH closer to neutral, partially treating both [[alkalosis]] and [[acidosis]], unless the patient has 0% [[blood loss]].
