# AED

 

---

An item used to correct the heartbeat of a patient. When used on a patient and charged with batteries, the AED has a chance to either reset [[manual defibrillator]] in every way, except for taking one second longer than the [[manual defibrillator]] to use. Between 80 and 100 medical skill, the [[manual defibrillator]] eclipses AED's chance to cure [[cardiac arrest]], but still has a (vanishing) danger of causing [[cardiac arrest]] or failing to correct [[fibrillation]], while the AED does not. At 100 medical skill, the [[manual defibrillator]] is superior. [[Manual defibrillator]] becomes perfectly safe, and is guaranteed to cure [[cardiac arrest]].
