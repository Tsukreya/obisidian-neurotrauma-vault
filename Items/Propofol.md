# Propofol

**Propofol is no longer craftable**

Propofol is a chemical used to knock a human unconscious. It's best used in surgery that has to be performed outside of the ship as it prevents the patient from getting [[traumatic shock]]. It has no Medical skill check.

Upon injection, the person on the receiving end will slowly gain [[analgesia]]. 

Once the affliction progresses past 16%, the player will fall into [[chest pain]] and surgery can be performed on them.
