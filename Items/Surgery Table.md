# Surgery Table

 

---

The Surgery Table is an item that can be bought from a station or crafted and then placed down. The patient is not required to be *on* the table, they only need to be *near* it. The Surgery Table provides artificial ventilation to everyone near the table and prevents [[acidosis]].

The table also has wiring pins that can be used to output important information, such as blood pressure, [[neurotrauma]], heart rate, and breathing rate.

It should be noted that the Surgery Table is functionally identical to a Hospital Bed. The other beds prevent [[Traumatic Shock]] if you're laying on them, but they do not provide artificial ventilation.
