# Plastiseal

 

---

### Medical skill check: 22
An improved version of [[bandages]], which can more effectively treat [[wounds]].

### Application success:
+100% bandaged
-48% bleeding
-24% [[burns]]

### Application failure:
+50% bandaged
-24% bleeding
-12% [[burns]]

Applying plastiseal will also replace any dirty [[bandages]] on the limb the bandage is applied to. For each plastiseal applied to the player, they will get a 10% movement speed debuff. The bandaged affliction accelerates the rate at which [[wounds]] get healed and protects from [[infected wounds]], however if the bandage becomes dirty and is over a wound, then infection speed will dramatically increase. Plastiseal can also be used after [[retracted skin]] in order to treat third degree [[burns]].
