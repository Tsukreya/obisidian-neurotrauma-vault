# Health Scanner

 

---

An item which is extremely important for diagnosis. Upon use and charged with batteries, you will get the readout of all afflictions visible to the health scanner, and the patient you're scanning will gain 0.5% [[radiation sickness]] per second, and you (the person scanning) will gain 0.3% per second. Additionally, one can scan themselves and others by using the health scanner in the interface like a treatment, as you would a bandage. This gives 1% [[radiation sickness]], and also allows you to scan individual limbs to find things such as [[foreign bodies]].
