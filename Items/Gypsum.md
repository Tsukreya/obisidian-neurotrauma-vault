# Gypsum

 

---

### Medical skill check: 40
A fine powder that when used in conjunction with [[bandages]], will encase a limb in a cast, in order to heal [[fractures]]. Gypsum will not work if you have not used [[bandages]] or [[plastiseal]] beforehand, and **will do nothing for skull, rib and neck [[fractures]].**

For each plaster cast applied to the player, they will get a 20% movement speed debuff. Plaster casts can be removed with [[trauma shears]].

### Application success:
Turns the applied bandage into a plaster cast, which will slowly heal arm and leg [[fractures]] encased in it.

### Application failure:
Deletes the gypsum and does nothing.
