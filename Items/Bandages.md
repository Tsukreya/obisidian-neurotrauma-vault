# Bandages

 

---

### Medical skill check: 10
Bandages used for covering [[wounds]] to prevent infection.

### Application success:
+50% bandaged
-24% bleeding

### Application failure:
+36% bandaged
-18% bleeding

Applying a bandage will also replace any dirty bandages on the limb the bandage is applied to. For each bandage applied to the player, they will get a 10% movement speed debuff. The bandaged affliction accelerates the rate at which [[wounds]] get healed and protects from [[infected wounds]], however if the bandage becomes dirty and is over a wound, then infection speed will dramatically increase. Bandages can be removed with [[trauma shears]] or a [[diving knife]].
