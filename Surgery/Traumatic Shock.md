# Traumatic Shock

 

---

Traumatic shock is very fatal, and should your patient acquire this at any point, immediately terminate the surgery, bring them back into the proximity of a [[surgery table]].

---
## Caused by:

- Performing unsafe surgery (without a table or without sedation)
- Using [[tweezers]] through gunshot [[wounds]] or deep tissue injuries (causes very minor shock, can usually be ignored)

## Causes:

- [[Hypotension]] (and lots of it)
- [[Cardiac arrest]] (at 40% or more)
- [[Respiratory arrest]] (at 30% or more)
- [[Neurotrauma]] (equal to strength divided by 100 per second, 10% or more is the point at which it outpaces natural regeneration)
- Psychosis (equal to strength divided by 100 per second)

## Treatments:

- Terminating the surgery and waiting
- Bringing into proximity of a [[surgery table]] and making sure the patient is sedated

## Prevention:

- Making sure that the surgery is safe before proceeding beyond the [[retracted skin]] step
- Making sure [[analgesia]] doesnt run out in the middle of surgery
