# Damaged Electronics

 

---

## Caused by:

- Being in water without a diving suit on 
- Getting attacked (75% chance for 200% of material loss, to a maximum of x3 at 100% material loss)

## Causes:

- Limb occassionally stops working temporarily, frequency scales with strength
- Limb becomes unusable (at 99% or more) 

## Treatments:

- FPGA circuits
