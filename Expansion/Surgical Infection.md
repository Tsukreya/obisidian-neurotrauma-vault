# Surgical Infection

 

---

Surgical Infection is a mechanic that causes [[sepsis]] based on how sterile the patient's environment is.

---

The following will *increase* sterility:
- Patient wearing surgical drapes (+100 base sterility)
- Nearby characters wearing surgical mask or surgeon clothing (scales with distance to patient)
- Having surgery skill (sterility gained based off this equation: 10 + surgery skill / 5)
- Having [[ointmented]] on the incision (+50 sterility)

---

The following will *decrease* sterility:
- Patient having no [[ointmented]] (sets sterility to the minimum)
- Nearby characters not wearing surgical mask or surgeon clothing (scales with distance to patient)

---

At the minimum sterility, there is a 10% chance every two seconds for the patient to acquire [[sepsis]].
