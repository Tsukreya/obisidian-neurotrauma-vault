# Acidosis

 

---

Acidosis is usually ignorable, and minimal action is required at low to medium severity. Acidosis and [[alkalosis]] will cancel each other out.

---
## Caused by:

- [[Hypoventilation]]
- [[Respiratory arrest]]
- [[Cardiac arrest]]
- [[Kidney damage]] (80% or more)
- [[Blood packs]] who's donor had acidosis (acidosis gained will be the donor's acidosis level at time of extraction divided by 5)
- [[Saline]]

## Causes:

- [[Seizure]] (at 60% or more)
- [[Coma]] (at 60% or more)
- [[Increased heartrate]] (at 20% or more)
- [[Fibrillation]]
- [[Headache]] (at 20% or more)
- [[Confusion]] (at 15% or more)
- [[Weakness]] (at 35% or more)

## Treatments:

- Treating the causes
- Inducing [[vomiting]])
- Transfusing neutral [[blood packs]] (unless the patient has 0% [[blood loss]])
