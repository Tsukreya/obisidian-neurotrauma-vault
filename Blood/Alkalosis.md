# Alkalosis

 

---

Alkalosis is usually ignorable, and minimal action is required at low to medium severity. Alkalosis and [[acidosis]] will cancel each other out.

---
## Caused by:

- [[Hyperventilation]]
- [[Vomiting]]
- [[Blood packs]] who's donor had alkalosis (alkalosis gained will be the donor's alkalosis level at time of extraction divided by 5)

## Causes:

- [[Seizure]] (at 60% or more)
- [[Palpitations]] (at 20% or more)

## Treatments:

- Treating the causes
- Inducing [[saline]])
- Transfusing neutral [[blood packs]] (unless the patient has 0% [[blood loss]])
