# FAQ *PLEASE READ!!!*

## Q: Why can't I find a specific affliction/item?
A: This guide is incomplete at the current moment, but try scrolling to the right first, or searching with ctrl + f, as there's more columns. If you still don't find it, put a comment down on this card (if you have a Trello account) or ping me on Discord telling me about the missing affliction/item and I'll add it as soon as possible.

## Q: What is the difference between Symptoms and other afflictions?
A: Symptoms are afflictions that don't do anything on their own, and merely exist to make diagnosis easier, while other afflictions have effects that actually impact gameplay.

## Q: Some of the information here is incorrect. How can I get you to fix it?
A: As with the first question, simply put a comment on this card (if you have a Trello account) or ping me on Discord telling me about the incorrect information, and I'll look into it.

## Q: Why is the guide on Trello instead of Steam now?
A: The steam guide was heavily riddled with misinformation, and generally steam has a bad layout for this kind of stuff.
