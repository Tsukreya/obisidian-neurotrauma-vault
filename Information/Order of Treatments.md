# Order of Treatments

#If the patient is in immediate danger of dying put them in a [[stasis bag]]
A [[stasis bag]] will give you 6 minutes of paused afflictions to diagnose, figure out your treatment plan, and administer any treatments short of surgery.

### Suggested treatments in order of importance
1. Put them in [[stasis bag]] if they're in rapidly deteriorating condition
2. Diagnose problems and figure out which steps from below are relevant
3. [[tourniquet]] any [[arterial bleeding]]
4. If there's major regular bleeding, [[sutures]] them, give [[blood packs]] if necessary and continue doing so in further steps if necessary. If they have internal or aortic bleeding, that will need to be fixed before transfusing blood or you will waste blood bags. Consider using [[liquid oxygenite]] further down to stabilize the patient for those surgeries.
5. Use a [[pneumothorax]] is high
6. If in [[stasis bag]], prep patient for removal from bag, give any drugs if they need it
\- [[azathioprine]]: if they need later organ transplants
\- Antirad or stabilozine: [[radiation sickness]] **IMPORTANT**
\- broad spectrum antibiotics: [[sepsis]]
\- [[mannitol]]: neurotrama reduction or healing if their blood is stable
\- [[morphine]]: painkiller for surgery
\- [[thiamine]]: organ damage healing
Then take them out of the [[stasis bag]] to start surgery (here's where you apply [[liquid oxygenite]] if you're going to after using a [[stasis bag]])
7. First aid for heartbeat/breathing if they're arrested or about to arrest (or if just taken out of [[stasis bag]], as that arrests heartbeat and breathing). Skip this step if they have massive internal or aortic bleeding to fix first.
8. Fix [[arterial bleeding]] properly. Give more blood if needed.
9. Properly fix any heart/breathing problems, including using [[pneumothorax]]
10. Fix bad [[burns]] (high second degree or any third degree)
\- Second degree: [[antibiotic ointment]] or [[bandages]] if that limb doesn't need surgery 
\- Third degree: [[antibiotic glue]], or if that limb needs surgery, wait till the end of surgery and use [[plastiseal]] before the closing [[sutures]].
11. Do spinal cord-injury
12. [[internal damage]] and blunt force trauma
13. [[Organ transplant surgery]] surgery if needed.
14. Apply [[sutures]] to close surgeries & to fix [[wounds]]
15. [[bandages]] then [[fractures]] on arms or legs to cast them
16. Use [[sepsis]] if you didn't give it to them earlier

An additional option is [[aortic rupture]] properly while not accruing damage for 30 seconds. It will cause some organ damage though.

You can also choose to use [[aortic rupture]] it might be a good idea to use LO2 and ignore the massive [[blood loss]] and replace the blood after fixing the [[aortic rupture]] and any other serious bleeding.
