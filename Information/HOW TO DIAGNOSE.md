# HOW TO DIAGNOSE

 

---

Diagnosing is used to describe the process of using the "Three H's":
- **H**ealth Interface - Provides things that are mostly surface level
- **H**ealth Scanner - Provides information about the internals
- **H**ematology Analyzer - Provides information about the blood

Using this method gives you the most information and makes it much easier to properly treat your patient and increase their chances of survival.
